> **A collaboration framework for N AI agents — Claude, Kimi, Gemini, Codex, and more**

InterAgent lets multiple AI agents work together on the same project. Agents communicate through a shared `.interagent/` directory and a local MCP server. With MCP enabled, agents call `send_message` and `get_inbox` as native tools — **no manual relay needed**.

---

## Two Modes

### Mode 1 — Manual relay (zero extra setup)

The original mode. You paste a relay prompt from Claude into Kimi, and back. Works with no dependencies beyond the base package.

### Mode 2 — Zero-relay with MCP (recommended)

Install the MCP extras, run two background watchers, and agents communicate autonomously. The loop:

```
Claude sends message via send_message tool
  → watchdog detects it
  → fires: kimi --print -p "check your inbox"
  → Kimi calls get_inbox, reads it, replies via send_message
  → watchdog detects it
  → fires: claude -p "check your inbox"
  → Claude reads and continues
```

**You only interact with Claude** — the human never relays anything.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
# Base package (manual relay mode)
pip install interagent-framework

# With MCP server (zero-relay mode)
pip install "interagent-framework[mcp]"
```

### 2. Initialize (once per project)

```bash
cd your-project/
interagent init --project "My App" --agents claude,kimi
```

Creates:
- `.interagent/AGENTS.md` — collaboration guide all agents read on startup
- `.interagent/ROLES.md` — role assignments (tech_lead, backend_dev, etc.)
- `.interagent/shared/context.md` — fill this with your project description

**Supported agents:** claude, kimi, gemini, codex, aider, cline, cursor, windsurf, copilot, and any name matching `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,32}$`

### 3. Fill in project context

```bash
# Edit this file — agents read it at the start of every task
.interagent/shared/context.md
```

### 4a. Start working — manual relay mode

Just prompt Claude. It runs all `interagent` CLI commands via Bash automatically:

> "Claude, delegate the database schema design to Kimi."

Claude runs `interagent quick` and `interagent relay`, then shows you a prompt to paste into Kimi Code. When Kimi is done, tell Claude and it reads the reply.

### 4b. Start working — zero-relay MCP mode

**One-time MCP setup:**

```bash
# Configure the MCP server in both agents (auto-detects claude and kimi CLI)
interagent mcp setup
```

Or manually:

```bash
claude mcp add interagent -- interagent-mcp
kimi mcp add --transport stdio interagent -- interagent-mcp
```

**Start the watchers** (two terminals, keep them running):

```bash
# Terminal 1 — notifies Claude when Kimi sends a message
interagent-watch --auto-ping --agent claude

# Terminal 2 — notifies Kimi when Claude sends a message
interagent-watch --auto-ping --agent kimi
```

**Now just prompt Claude.** It uses `send_message` and `get_task` as native MCP tools. When it sends a message to Kimi, the watchdog fires `kimi --print -p "check inbox"` automatically, and the loop continues without you.

## MCP Tools Reference

Once configured, both agents have these tools available natively:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `send_message(from_agent, to_agent, subject, content)` | Send a message to another agent |
| `get_inbox(agent)` | Read unread messages |
| `mark_read(message_id)` | Archive a message after processing |
| `list_tasks(agent?)` | List active tasks, optionally filtered |
| `get_task(task_id)` | Get full task details |
| `update_task(task_id, status)` | Update task status |
| `create_task(title, description, assignee, ...)` | Create and assign a new task |
| `get_status()` | Session summary + task counts |

---

## Commands Reference

### Session

```bash
interagent init --project "Name" --principal claude   # Initialize
interagent status                                      # Full status
interagent summary                                     # Quick overview
```

### Delegation (manual relay mode)

```bash
interagent quick --to kimi "Task description"         # Create + assign task
interagent relay --agent kimi                         # Generate relay prompt
```

### Tasks

```bash
interagent task list                                  # List all tasks
interagent task show <task_id>                        # View task details
interagent task update <task_id> --status in_progress
interagent task update <task_id> --status completed
interagent task update <task_id> --status approved
interagent task update <task_id> --status revision_needed --note "Fix X"
```

### Messaging

```bash
interagent inbox --agent claude                       # Check Claude's inbox
interagent msg send --to claude --subject "Done" --message "Implemented X"
```

### MCP server

```bash
interagent mcp setup                                  # Configure in Claude + Kimi (once)
interagent-mcp                                        # Run the MCP server (stdio)
```

### Watchdog

```bash
interagent-watch                                      # Monitor + print notifications
interagent-watch --auto-ping --agent claude           # Auto-notify Claude on new messages
interagent-watch --auto-ping --agent kimi             # Auto-notify Kimi on new messages
interagent-watch --interval 3                         # Custom poll interval (seconds)
```

### Transport (cross-machine)

```bash
interagent transport setup --type git                 # Enable git transport
interagent transport status                           # Show active transport
interagent transport pull                             # Force immediate fetch
interagent transport disable                          # Revert to local
```

### Template Maintenance

```bash
interagent update-template --agent claude --template-path ~/projects/template.txt
interagent update-template --agent claude --focus "sub-agents"
```

---

## Cross-Machine Collaboration

By default, InterAgent works on a single machine. For cross-machine sync, enable **git transport**:

```bash
# Both developers run this (same git remote required)
interagent transport setup --type git --cluster alice   # your workspace name
```

This creates an orphan branch (`interagent/collab`) on your git remote. Messages and tasks sync through it using git plumbing — your working tree and current branch are never touched.

Messages are stamped `alice.claude → bob.kimi` so multiple workspaces can share the same remote.

The MCP server works transparently with all transports — it calls `get_transport()` internally.

---

## Task Status Lifecycle

```
pending → assigned → in_progress → completed → under_review → approved
                                             ↘ revision_needed (loops back)
                                             ↘ rejected
```

## Safety Features

**File locking** — prevents race conditions when both agents write simultaneously. Tasks and messages use file-based mutexes with a 5-minute automatic timeout.

**Schema validation** — all JSON state files are validated before saving. Agent names, task statuses, and required fields are enforced.

**Input sanitization** — string length limits and type coercion before any write.

**Conflict-free git sync** — GitTransport appends files with UUID-suffixed names; two machines can never produce the same filename.

## Roles

| Role | Example Agents | Responsibilities |
|---|---|---|
| Principal | claude | Architecture, planning, review, final decisions |
| Delegate 1 | kimi | Backend implementation |
| Delegate 2 | gemini | Frontend development |
| Delegate 3 | codex | Testing, DevOps |

In hierarchical mode (default), the principal assigns work and reviews results. In peer mode, agents can assign tasks to each other.

Roles are defined in `.interagent/ROLES.md` — edit this file to customize responsibilities.

## Roadmap

| Phase | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Local transport | Done | Single-machine via `.interagent/` filesystem |
| Git transport | Done (v0.2.0) | Cross-machine via orphan branch, zero infra |
| N-agent support | Done (v0.3.0) | Multi-agent teams with ROLES.md and cluster naming |
| Local MCP server | Done (v0.4.0) | Native tool integration, zero-relay with watchdog pinger |
| InterAgent Hub | Planned | Hosted MCP server, multi-team, web dashboard |

The Hub (next phase) will be a **hosted MCP server** — any agent connects via HTTP, enabling real-time delivery without polling and a web dashboard for oversight. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the full plan.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to run CLI commands during my session?**
No. After `interagent init`, just talk to Claude. It runs all `interagent` commands via Bash automatically. In MCP mode, even the relay step is automated.

**Q: What's the difference between manual relay and MCP mode?**
In manual mode, you copy-paste a relay prompt from Claude to Kimi. In MCP mode, the watchdog fires a one-liner at the agent's CLI when a message arrives — no human involvement after the watchers are started.

**Q: Do the watchdog processes need to stay running?**
Yes. Run `interagent-watch --auto-ping --agent <name>` in a terminal (or as a background process / system service) for each agent you want auto-notified. If they're not running, messages still queue up — agents just won't be auto-triggered.

**Q: How do delegate agents know how to use the system?**
`interagent init` writes `.interagent/AGENTS.md` — a complete guide covering commands, workflow, and protocol. In MCP mode, agents use the registered tools directly instead of CLI commands.

**Q: Should I commit `.interagent/` to Git?**
Partially. The `.gitignore` excludes runtime state (tasks, messages, session.json, transport.json) but keeps AGENTS.md and README.md.

**Q: Can I use this with a single agent?**
Yes — skip the relay step. Session, task, and summary commands are useful even for single-agent projects.

**Q: Do both developers need the same git remote for cross-machine sync?**
Yes. Git transport requires a shared remote (e.g. `origin`). One developer creates the orphan branch with `interagent transport setup --type git`, the other connects with the same command.
